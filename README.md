# DO NOT USE THIS AS OF 10/30/23
this code is not meant for competiton, as it has a major problem

the main known problem is that the steering motor goes haywire with the slightest touch of the joystick

this code was meant for seeing how swerve works and uses a modified verison of the zero to autonomous code:
https://github.com/SeanSun6814/FRC0ToAutonomous/tree/master/%236%20Swerve%20Drive%20Auto
- I made the code work with the modern version of wpilib and change the anolog encoders with CANandcoders connected to the steering max
- the problem started when I changed the gear ratio constant to fit the MK4i
- this published code is meant for community debugging
